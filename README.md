# OrientationChatbot
This project features an AI-powered orientation chatbot designed to assist students with educational guidance, particularly in the Cycle Préparatoire Intégré and Engineering Cycle. Built on the TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 model, the chatbot has been fine-tuned to deliver accurate information and guidance.

Key features include:

Text Generation: Provides accurate, AI-generated responses to user queries about educational programs.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts chatbot responses into audio, enhancing accessibility.
Speech Recognition: Allows users to interact with the chatbot using voice commands, making the experience more intuitive.
While the chatbot currently has a 70% accuracy rate, it offers substantial orientation guidance, with ongoing improvements planned for increased reliability.

In this repository, you will find:

The code for fine-tuning the model and creating the chatbot.
A few CSV files used in data manipulation.
A code example demonstrating our data preparation process.
Please note that the original PDF file and HTML page used for web scraping are not linked here, but you can use any PDF file in your directory as a substitute. Not all data configurations are included, but the provided code should offer a clear example of our approach.
